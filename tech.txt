üñ•Ô∏è Guided Notes: Computer Engineering & the Technology that Powers Society
1. What is Computer Engineering?

Definition: A field at the intersection of electrical engineering and computer science.

Focus: Designing and building computer hardware, software, and integrated systems.

Applications: From microprocessors and embedded systems to large-scale cloud computing and AI.


2. Core Components of Computer Engineering
A. Hardware

Processors (CPU, GPU, TPU): Brain of the computer; execute instructions.

Memory (RAM, Cache, Storage): Store and retrieve data.

Motherboards & Buses: Connect all components.

Specialized Chips: ASICs, FPGAs for custom tasks (cryptography, AI acceleration).

B. Software

Operating Systems (Windows, Linux, macOS): Manage hardware and resources.

Programming Languages: Low-level (C, Assembly) vs. high-level (Python, Java).

Embedded Systems Software: Runs on devices like cars, appliances, medical devices.

C. Networking

Internet Protocols (TCP/IP): Rules for data transfer.

Wireless Communication: Wi-Fi, 5G, Bluetooth.

Cloud Infrastructure: Data centers, edge computing.

D. Integration of Hardware & Software

IoT (Internet of Things): Everyday devices connected via sensors and microcontrollers.

Cyber-Physical Systems: Self-driving cars, robotics, industrial automation.

How Does a Computer Network Work
Basics building blocks of a Computer network are Nodes and Links.

A Network Node can be illustrated as Equipment for Data Communication like a Modem, Router, etc., or Equipment of a Data Terminal like connecting two computers or more.
Link in Computer Networks can be defined as wires or cables or free space of wireless networks (as shown in the below diagram)
The working of Computer Networks can be simply defined as rules or protocols which help in sending and receiving data via the links which allow Computer networks to communicate.
Each device has an IP Address, that helps in identifying the device.
A firewall is a network security device either hardware or software-based which monitors all incoming and outgoing traffic and based on a defined set of security rules it accepts, rejects, or drops that specific traffic .

Network: A group of connected computers and devices that can communicate and share data with each other.
Node: Any device that can send, receive, or forward data in a network. This includes laptops, mobiles, printers, earbuds, servers, etc.
Networking Devices: Devices that manage and support networking functions. This includes routers, switches, hubs, and access points.
Transmission Media: The physical or wireless medium through which data travels between devices.
Wired media: Ethernet cables, optical fiber.
Wireless media: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, infrared
Service Provider Networks: Networks offered by external providers that allow users or organizations to lease network access and capabilities. This includes internet providers, mobile carriers, etc.


How Does a Computer Network Work
Basics building blocks of a Computer network are Nodes and Links.

A Network Node can be illustrated as Equipment for Data Communication like a Modem, Router, etc., or Equipment of a Data Terminal like connecting two computers or more.
Link in Computer Networks can be defined as wires or cables or free space of wireless networks (as shown in the below diagram)
The working of Computer Networks can be simply defined as rules or protocols which help in sending and receiving data via the links which allow Computer networks to communicate.
Each device has an IP Address, that helps in identifying the device.
A firewall is a network security device either hardware or software-based which monitors all incoming and outgoing traffic and based on a defined set of security rules it accepts, rejects, or drops that specific traffic .


Network Security
Ensuring the security of a network is crucial to protect data and resources from unauthorized access and attacks. Key aspects of network security include:

Firewalls: Devices or software that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.
Encryption: The process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access. Commonly used in VPNs, HTTPS, and secure email.
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Tools that monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and potential threats.
Access Control: Mechanisms that restrict access to network resources based on user identity and role.
Regular Updates and Patching: Keeping software and hardware up to date to protect against vulnerabilities.


Characteristics of Computer Networks
Computer networks are systems that connect multiple devices to facilitate communication, resource sharing, and data transfer. 
They possess several key characteristics that ensure efficient and secure operations. These characteristics include Security, Reliability, Scalability, 
Performance, Fault Tolerance, and hardware and software support
